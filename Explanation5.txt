PROBLEM 5: BLOCKCHAIN

The BLockchain implementation requires time complexity of O(n) depending on how many sequential chains are recorded. A singly linked
list allows for each chain to point to its predecessor. The space complexity would depend on the type of data being hashed, as well as
hash type being used. The space complexity should be O(n) for this program strictly based on the number of characters to be encoded.
The SHA256 output should have the same storage requirements regardless of the input.
