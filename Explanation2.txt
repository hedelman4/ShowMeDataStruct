PROBLEM 2: FILE RECURSION

I used recursion to find the file path leaves that were not themselves directories containing other files. Once at the leaf level,
I would store file paths that end with ".c" in an otherwise empty array.

The function involves checking every possible file path in the inital directory, thus requiring time complexity O(n) dependent upon how
many leaves there are in the initial directory. The space complexity would be O(n) based on the number of files in the directory.
